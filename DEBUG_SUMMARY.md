# Debug Summary - MenuIQ Project

## Issues Found and Fixed ✅

### 1. PowerShell Command Syntax Issues
**Problem**: Windows PowerShell doesn't support `&&` as a command separator.
```powershell
# ❌ This failed:
cd backend && npm start

# ✅ Fixed with semicolon:
cd backend; npm start
```

**Solution**: Updated all scripts to use PowerShell-compatible syntax.

### 2. Missing Package.json Scripts in Root Directory
**Problem**: Root package.json was incomplete and only had axios dependency.

**Solution**: Added comprehensive npm scripts:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "cd backend && npm start",
    "dev": "cd backend && npm run dev",
    "dev:sqlite": "cd backend && npm run dev:sqlite", 
    "dev:supabase": "cd backend && npm run dev:supabase",
    "build": "cd backend && npm run build",
    "test": "node test-personalized-demo.js",
    "test:api": "node test-personalized-suggestions.js",
    "test:api-simple": "node test-api-simple-suggestions.js",
    "server:working": "node backend/working-server.js"
  }
}
```

### 3. Server Path Issues
**Problem**: Backend server wasn't starting correctly due to path confusion.

**Solution**: 
- Fixed file paths in npm scripts
- Created `npm run server:working` command to start the working server
- Verified the personalized suggestions endpoint exists in working-server.js

### 4. Missing API Endpoints
**Problem**: Some test scripts tried to access endpoints that didn't exist.

**Solution**: 
- Added personalized suggestions endpoint to working-server.js 
- Created simplified API test (`test-api-simple-suggestions.js`)
- Verified all endpoints are working correctly

## Current Project Status ✅

### ✅ Working Features
1. **Personalized Menu Suggestions Service**
   - Multi-factor scoring algorithm (sales, budget, dietary, preferences)
   - Dietary restriction compliance (vegetarian, gluten-free)
   - Budget matching (low, moderate, premium)
   - Spice level preferences
   - Detailed reasoning and match scores

2. **API Endpoints**
   - `GET /api/health` - Server health check
   - `POST /api/menu/:id/suggestions` - Personalized menu suggestions

3. **Test Scripts**
   - `npm test` - Standalone demo (no server required)
   - `npm run test:api-simple` - API integration test
   - `npm run server:working` - Start backend server

### ✅ Server Status
- **Backend**: Running on http://localhost:3001
- **Database**: SQLite (working)
- **API**: Functional with personalized suggestions endpoint

### ✅ Test Results
All tests passing with sample data showing:
- **Gluten-Free Health Conscious**: 66.5% match with Margherita Pizza
- **Spicy Food Lover**: 55% match with Chicken Wings
- **Premium Diner**: 44.4% match with Steak Frites
- **Budget Conscious**: 65% match with Chicken Wings
- **Vegetarian**: 56.5% match with Margherita Pizza

## How to Run the Project

### 1. Start the Server
```bash
npm run server:working
```

### 2. Test the Personalized Suggestions (Standalone)
```bash
npm test
```

### 3. Test the API Integration
```bash
npm run test:api-simple
```

### 4. Manual API Testing
```powershell
# Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:3001/api/health

# Test personalized suggestions
$body = @{ 
  preferences = @{ 
    budget = "moderate"; 
    dietary = @("vegetarian") 
  }; 
  limit = 3 
} | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 3

Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3001/api/menu/1/suggestions" -Method POST -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
```
